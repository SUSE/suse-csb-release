# suse-csb-release

## Project Description
SUSE IT needs help from fellow geekos with release engineering skills to define the requirements, process, infrastructure, and tools for building an openSUSE-based distribution bundled with SUSE IT-supported application stack. The resulting OS build will be offered as a standard distribution for new SUSE employees in addition to the existing Operating System library.

## Goal for this Hackweek
* Define requirements (and name) for the build.
* Selected features implemented for the MVP.
* Define a process for updating the image with the future releases of openSUSE.
* Identify and deploy required infrastructure and repositories.
* Produce an installable OS image that can be used by volunteers across the company.
* Document everything.
* Have a lot of fun in the process.

## MVP requirements
* the deployment do the end-user machine is unattended
* machine has disk encrypted
* once the machine is provisioned, it is added to asset DB (serial number + asset owner)
* productivity tools are installed
* Details are tracked here: https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Leap:CSBRequirements
